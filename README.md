# AES_cipher_encryption_algorithm implimentation 1

The AES cypher was impliment using Python3.
Juypter Notebook was used as the IDE however the code was also copied into a .py file for ease of use.

Libraries used include:

Crypto.Cipher - The Crypto.Cipher package contains algorithms for protecting the confidentiality of data. AES algorythm was used from this package.
Crypto.Hash - Cryptographic hash functions take arbitrary binary strings as input, and produce a random-like fixed-length output (called digest or hash value).
